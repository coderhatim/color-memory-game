# ColorRecall ðŸŽ®ðŸŒˆ

**ColorRecall** is a console-based memory game inspired by the classic "Simon Says." Test your memory and reflexes as you try to repeat increasingly complex color sequences displayed using colorful emojis!

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The game displays a sequence of colors using emojis (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µðŸŸ¡ etc.).
- Your task is to memorize the sequence and input the corresponding number for each color.
- With each round, the sequence gets longer, making it more challenging.
- One wrong input ends the game!
